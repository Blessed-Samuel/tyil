Leadership is not about titles or positions — it’s about **influence, responsibility, and impact**.  
Through interactive sessions, team challenges, and mentorship opportunities, participants discover their unique leadership styles and learn how to use them effectively.

## Programme Focus Areas

- **Vision & Purpose:** Discovering your “why” and turning it into action.  
- **Effective Communication:** Learning to express ideas clearly and confidently.  
- **Emotional Intelligence:** Understanding yourself and others to lead with empathy.  
- **Decision Making:** Building courage and confidence to make wise choices.  
- **Community Impact:** Creating real change through service and collaboration.

## Why It Matters

When young people are equipped with leadership skills, they don’t just dream about change — **they lead it**.  
This programme nurtures a generation of responsible, disciplined, and visionary leaders ready to transform their schools, workplaces, and communities.
